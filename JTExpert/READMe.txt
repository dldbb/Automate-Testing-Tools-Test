!!   instantiation of its classes may lead to an undesirable behavior without precautions          !!

To execute JTExpert in a safe mode, we highly recommend that you use a user with very restrictive access, 
e.g., that can only read classes under test and dependencies, execute JTExpert, and write test data 
in a specific directory.


CONTENTS
       
        benchmarks      A suite of Java files used for benchmarking 
                        JTExpert implementation.

        lib             Contains all libraries used by JTExpert.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Java 8
JUnit 4

INSTALLATION 

Step 1. Download and unzip the JTExpert package.

The jar file is installed in the JTExpert main directory.

Step 2. Try it out!

I) Test-data generation for all-branches coverage
	If we suppose that the JTExpert's home directory is in your PATH and called JTE_HOME, the test suite can be generated by:

       $ java -jar -Xms1G -Xmx1G JTE_HOME/JTExpert-1.4.jar -cp JTE_HOME/benchmarks/commons/cp/commons-lang3-3.1.jar -jf JTE_HOME/benchmarks/commons/org/apache/commons/lang3/ArrayUtils.java -maxTime 60 -tp JTE_HOME/output/commons/60/82895723457381  -seed 82895723457381 -p -s -o 

	Options:
		-cp: to set the class path
		-jf: to set the Java file under test
		-maxTime: to set the time limit
		-tp: to set the work directory, wherein the test suite will be saved.
		-p: to print a progress bar
		-s: to show messages and errors thrown by the class under test
		-o: to override an existing test data file
